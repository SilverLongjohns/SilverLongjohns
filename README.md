I'm a passionate full-stack developer, pushing myself in all sorts of directions with the help of some great colleagues. Just finished a wonderful TypeScript project, and am now moving into Python and infrastructure architecturing. If you're looking to chat about game dev, your startup or coding bootcamps, I'm all ears!


:busts_in_silhouette: Currently working for Build Circle, a UK-based tech consultancy!

:eyes: My favourite side project right now is a top secret Unity game!

:mage_man: My current after-work obessions are New Blood games. Keep publishing classics, you're doing brilliantly!
