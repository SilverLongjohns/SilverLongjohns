# Hi, I'm Jake - Welcome to my Code Sandbox!

### This is where I learn and develop skills for use in my professional life, as well as being a testbed for all sorts of fun ideas!

I'm a passionate full-stack developer, pushing myself in all sorts of directions. Currently my main focus is working in C# and upping my skills there. If you're looking to chat about game dev, startups or coding bootcamps, I'm all ears!

:eyes: My favourite side project right now is a top secret Unity game!

:mage_man: My current after-work obessions are New Blood games. Keep publishing classics, you're doing brilliantly!
